		<h2>Let's get acquainted.</h2>

		<p>Currently working as a full-stack developer in Toronto, Canada.
		</p>
		<p>
		I value independence and creative freedom the most in projects.
		<br/>
		As a team member I am cooperative, as a leader I am quietly supportive.
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="thick">things I get excited about: </span>
				levelling up a meta-skill (a skill of skills), tumblr, internet counterculture, daring people
		</p>
		<p>
				<span class="thick">greatest strength: </span> 
				passion
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="thick">greatest weakness: </span> 
				trying not to do everything myself because my teammates can’t meet my impossibly high standards, but this is usually avoided by my desire for cooperation
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="thick">favourite framework of the moment: </span> 
				angular, because it lets me invent yet keeps me disciplined
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="thick">reason I got into programming: </span> 
				my parents are both circa 90s programmers, and it was the only thing I was good at in college
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="thick">sense of humour: </span> 
				unique and self-deprecating
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="thick">if I could shadow one person: </span> 	
				Marissa Mayer
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="thick">when I’m in the zone: </span> 
				headphones on, world off. << d(-_-)b >>

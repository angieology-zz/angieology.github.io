		<h2>Let's get acquainted.</h2>

		<p>Currently working as a full-stack developer in Toronto, Canada.
		</p>
		<p>
		I value independence and creative freedom the most in projects.
		<br/>
		As a team member I am cooperative, as a leader I am quietly supportive.
		</p>
		<p>

				Learning new things, bizzare ideas, being able to make a difference
		</p>
		<p>

				Belief that nothing is impossible
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="thick">greatest weakness: </span> 
				Trying to improve things that are already good enough
		</p>
